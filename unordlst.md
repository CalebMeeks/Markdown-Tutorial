Unordered lists are useful when listing stuff where the order has no effect on the list. 

Grocery List
+ Eggs
+ Milk
+ Honey
+ Lucky Charms
+ Sugar

You do this by adding a + and a space before what you are listing on each new line.

If you need to nest items on an unordered list you can hit tab on the new line before the +.

Revised Grocery List
+ Pancakes
  + Milk
  + Eggs
  + Pancake Mix 
+ Syrup
+ Butter
